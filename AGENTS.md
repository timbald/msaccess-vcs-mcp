# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Guide to msaccess-vcs-mcp

## Purpose

This repository contains the **msaccess-vcs-mcp** server — a lightweight MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge that lets AI agents drive the [MSAccess VCS Add-in](https://github.com/joyfullservice/msaccess-vcs-addin) for version-controlling Microsoft Access databases.

## Development Environment Setup

**Always use the project virtual environment.** The package is installed in editable mode inside `venv/`. Do not install globally or suggest `pip install` outside the venv.

```powershell
# Activate the virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
cd C:\Repos\msaccess-vcs-mcp
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# If the venv doesn't exist yet, create it first:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests

Tests must run inside the activated virtual environment:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run all unit tests
pytest

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_usage_logging.py -v

# Skip integration tests (require Access installed)
pytest -m "not integration"

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=msaccess_vcs_mcp --cov-report=html
```

## Architecture

All tools are registered with the `@vcs_tool("name")` decorator in `tools.py`, which composes three concerns in order:

1. **Config reload** — `load_config()` re-reads `.env` when it changes
2. **Usage logging** — `with_logging(name)` records tool calls to JSONL
3. **MCP registration** — `mcp.tool()` exposes the function to MCP clients

```

## Configuration

All settings come from environment variables (loaded from `.env` / `.env.local` in the project root). See `.env.example` for the full list.

Key variables:
- `ACCESS_VCS_DATABASE` — target database path
- `ACCESS_VCS_DISABLE_WRITES` — set `true` to block write operations
- `ACCESS_VCS_ENABLE_LOGGING` — set `true` to enable usage logging
- `ACCESS_VCS_RUN_VBA_TIMEOUT_SEC` — parent-side timeout for `vcs_run_vba` worker processes (default 45s)
- `ACCESS_VCS_RECOVERY_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SEC` — timeout for automatic Access/add-in recovery probes after a VBA timeout or COM disconnect (default 10s)

`vcs_run_vba` executes Access COM work in a short-lived child Python process. If a snippet hangs because Access is in break mode, blocked on a modal dialog, or otherwise unresponsive, the MCP server kills only that child process and returns a recoverable timeout. It does **not** kill `MSACCESS.EXE` or close user-owned Access windows; after Access becomes responsive, the next call runs an automatic probe and resumes normal operation.

### Rebuilding the VCS add-in

To rebuild `Version Control.accda` from source after editing add-in files, do **not** use `vcs_rebuild_database` (that rebuilds a user project). Call:

```python
vcs_call_vba(db, "VCS.API", ["RebuildAddIn", r"C:\Repos\msaccess-vcs-addin\Version Control.accda.src"])
```

Read `statusFile` from the JSON. Access then exits (a COM error on that call is expected). Poll `<source>/logs/rebuild-status.json` with the Read tool until `status` is `complete` or `*-failed`/`refused`. The rebuild refuses when another `MSACCESS.EXE` in the session holds a file it must replace, or cannot be asked which files it holds, and never closes another process; `otherInstances` in the refusal names what to close. `vcs_call_vba` has no timeout — the worker sleeps before quitting so the JSON can return.

## Logging

The server writes two parallel JSON Lines streams. Both filenames use the `vcs-mcp-` prefix so they don't collide with other tools that share the same logs directory.

### VCS operation logs (written by the add-in, not the server)

Separate from the two streams below, the add-in writes a per-operation log to `{source_dir}/logs/<Base>_<yyyymmdd_hhnnss_fff>.log`, where `<Base>` is `Export`, `Merge`, `Build`, `TestRun`, or `Other`. Note the base name tracks the *operation*, not the tool: `vcs_import_objects` and `vcs_import_object` both produce `Merge_*.log`.

The add-in also writes a `.gitignore` into the source folder containing `logs/` and `*.log`, which means **Cursor's Glob and Grep silently skip these files** — a search returns no matches rather than an error, so an agent can burn several calls before falling back to a shell listing. To avoid that:

- Every operation tool returns `log_path` for the run it just performed. Use it directly with the Read tool.
- On failure, those tools also return `log_excerpt` (tail of the log), so the error is usually available without any follow-up call.
- If the path is no longer at hand, call `vcs_get_log(database_path, log_type=...)` with the base name matching the operation.

The add-in's sync API returns this as camelCase `logPath`; `_addin_json_result` in `tools.py` normalizes it to `log_path` at the boundary and keeps the original key as an alias. Async completion callbacks already use `log_path`. Keep the normalizer even if the add-in changes: a newer server may run against an older add-in build.

### Diagnostic stream (`vcs-mcp-diagnostic.jsonl`) — always on

Captures server lifecycle events: `server_start`, `startup_env_load`, `lazy_env_load`, `lazy_init_started`, `lazy_init_skipped`, `list_roots_failed`, `list_roots_response`, `lazy_init_loaded`, `lazy_init_no_env_in_roots`, `usage_log_status`. Independent of `ACCESS_VCS_ENABLE_LOGGING` so it answers the "why didn't logging work?" question even when usage logging is silent.

- **Location:** `~/.msaccess-vcs-mcp/logs/vcs-mcp-diagnostic.jsonl`
- **Override:** `ACCESS_VCS_DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_DIR`
- **Opt out:** `ACCESS_VCS_DISABLE_DIAGNOSTIC_LOG=true`
- **Rotation:** 1 MB per file, 3 backups
- **Discoverable from agents:** `vcs_get_version_info()` returns the active `diagnostic_log_path`.

### Usage stream (`vcs-mcp-usage.jsonl`) — default on

When `ACCESS_VCS_ENABLE_LOGGING=true` (the default), every tool call writes a structured entry. Set the env var to `false` to opt out.

- **Development installs:** logs to `{project_root}/logs/vcs-mcp-usage.jsonl`
- **Package installs:** logs to `~/.msaccess-vcs-mcp/logs/vcs-mcp-usage.jsonl`
- **Override:** `ACCESS_VCS_LOG_DIR`
- **Rotation:** `ACCESS_VCS_LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB` (default 10 MB), `ACCESS_VCS_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` (default 5)

Each `tool_call` entry includes: `timestamp`, `version`, `event`, `tool`, `parameters`, `success`, `error`, `error_pattern`, `execution_time_ms`.

### Tiered audit posture

Three sensitivity tiers in the usage stream, each independently controlled:

1. **Audit metadata** — always written when `ENABLE_LOGGING=true`. Tool name, timing, success/error, sanitized parameter dict.
2. **Code-execution bodies** — `vcs_execute_sql`, `vcs_call_vba`, and `vcs_run_vba` write a `"code_execution"` event *before* execution begins. By default only `code_length` is recorded. Set `ACCESS_VCS_LOG_CODE_CONTENT=true` to record the full `code` field for forensic replay (off by default to limit business-data exposure). `code_length` lets analysts spot anomalies (e.g. "an agent ran a 4 KB VBA block") without seeing the body.
3. **Credential-shaped parameter keys** — any parameter whose name matches `password`, `secret`, `token`, `api_key`, `apikey`, `connection_string`, or `connectionstring` (case-insensitive) is replaced with `"<redacted>"` regardless of other switches. Defense in depth.

## Adding a New Tool

1. Write the handler function in `tools.py`
2. Decorate with `@vcs_tool("vcs_your_tool_name")` — this handles config reload, usage logging, and MCP registration automatically
3. Add tests in `tests/`

## Key Conventions

- All tool names use the `vcs_` prefix
- Tool handlers return `dict[str, Any]` with at least a `success` key
- Error results include `"error"` key (detected by usage logging)
- Async tools (`async def`) are supported by `@vcs_tool` transparently
- `Context` parameters from FastMCP are filtered out of usage logs automatically
