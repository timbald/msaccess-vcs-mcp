"""
MCP tool definitions for msaccess-vcs-mcp.

This module provides database version control tools for AI assistants working with
Microsoft Access databases. All tools use the ``vcs_`` prefix to indicate they
control the VCS add-in, not the Access application itself.

**Getting Started Workflow:**
1. Use vcs_list_objects() to see what's in a database
2. Use vcs_export_database() to export all objects to source directory
3. Edit source files using your preferred tools
4. Use vcs_diff_database() to see what changed
5. Use vcs_import_objects() or vcs_rebuild_database() to apply changes

**Key Features:**
- Export Access objects to git-friendly text files
- Import objects from source files back into Access
- Rebuild entire databases from source
- Track changes between database and source
- Export/import individual objects by name and type
- Execute read-only SQL queries via the add-in's DAO connection
- Call existing VBA functions or run agent-generated VBA code
- Read/write add-in options for session-level configuration
- Read operations always available, write operations require permission
- Long-running operations support progress reporting via callbacks

# ``ctx: Context`` parameter -- by retrieving the request context via

    """
    Import objects from source files into Access database.
    
    Merges source files back into the database. With no ``object_types``, runs
    a full project merge (``MergeBuild``) with progress callbacks. With
    ``object_types``, runs a category-scoped merge via ``ImportByType`` —
    only those categories are touched.
    
    **Scoped import (when object_types is set):**
    
    - Database objects in the named categories with no corresponding source
      file are **deleted** (orphan reconciliation).
    - No database backup is taken (unlike a full ``MergeBuild``). Own your
      backup before a destructive scoped merge.
    - ``full_import=False`` (default) merges only files the VCS index marks
      as changed. A stale or reset index can under-report; pass
      ``full_import=True`` to reload every source file in those categories
      regardless of the index. That path also skips conflict detection
      (source wins for the named categories).
    - Passing every category with ``full_import=True`` approximates a full
      build without a backup — prefer ``vcs_rebuild_database`` there.
    - Scoped calls are synchronous (no progress reporting). Prefer a single
      object via ``vcs_import_object`` when you only need one name.
    
    ``source_dir`` must exist and is used for log resolution; the merge itself
    reads from the project's configured export folder.
    
    Examples:
        # Full project merge
        vcs_import_objects("C:\\\\db.accdb", "C:\\\\src\\\\mydb")
        
        # Merge only queries (changed source files)

            object_types=["modules"],
            full_import=True,
        )
    
    Args:
        database_path: Path to Access database
        source_dir: Directory containing source files (must exist; merge uses
            the project's export folder)
        object_types: Optional categories to merge (e.g. ``["queries"]``,
            ``["modules", "forms"]``). If None, merges the entire project.
        full_import: When ``object_types`` is set: if False (default), merge
            only changed source files; if True, merge all source files in
            those categories (ignores the change index, skips conflict
            prompts). Ignored for a full project merge.
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with import results and any errors, plus ``log_path`` for
        this run's log and ``log_excerpt`` (tail of the log) on failure.
    
    The add-in gitignores its ``logs`` folder, so Glob/Grep will not find
    these files. Open ``log_path`` directly, or call vcs_get_log("Merge").

    Build a complete Access database from source files.
    
    Creates a fresh database and imports all objects from source.
    Useful for clean builds and distribution.
    
    This operation supports progress reporting - you'll receive updates
    as the database is built.
    
    Examples:
        # Rebuild from source
        vcs_rebuild_database("C:\\\\src\\\\mydb", "C:\\\\output\\\\rebuilt.accdb")

    Rebuild the VCS add-in from source and wait until it is installed.

    Derives the development copy (the ``Version Control.accda`` beside
    ``source_dir``), launches ``RebuildAddIn``, and watches
    ``<source>/logs/rebuild-status.json`` until this attempt reaches
    ``complete`` or a terminal failure. The Access gate is held only for
    the launch; other tools can run while the worker builds.

    Before launch, the server closes Access windows it created that hold
    the development copy or the installed add-in. User-owned windows are
    left alone and still produce ``refused`` / ``otherInstances``.

    This is not ``vcs_rebuild_database``, which rebuilds a user project.
    ``vcs_call_vba(..., ["RebuildAddIn", source])`` remains a launch-only
    escape hatch and does not wait for the rebuild to finish.

    Call an existing public VBA function by name.
    
    Invokes a function that already exists in the database or a loaded library
    via Application.Run. Lighter weight than vcs_run_vba since there is no
    temp module creation or compilation step.

    **This is the correct tool for reaching the VCS add-in's own API.** Pass "VCS.API"
    (or "Version Control.API" / "MSAccessVCS.API") as function_name and it is rewritten
    to the configured add-in's full path, which also loads the add-in on demand. Do NOT
    try to reach the API from inside vcs_run_vba: that code is itself delivered through
    modAPI.API, so calling back into the API is a re-entrant call and will be refused.

    **Prefer ``vcs_rebuild_addin(source_dir)`` to rebuild the add-in.** This tool
    remains a launch-only escape hatch for ``RebuildAddIn``: it returns when the
    worker is confirmed and does not wait for install. Host it on the development
    copy (the ``Version Control.accda`` beside the source folder). The installed
    add-in is refused as ``database_path`` here as it is everywhere, with
    ``installed_addin_refused``.

    Examples:
        vcs_call_vba("C:\\\\db.accdb", "MyModule.GetQuerySQL", ["qryCustomers"])
        vcs_call_vba("C:\\\\db.accdb", "VCS.API", ["GetVCSVersion"])
        vcs_call_vba("C:\\\\db.accdb", "VCS.API", ["RunRoundtripTests", "C:\\\\fixtures\\\\"])
        vcs_call_vba("C:\\\\db.accdb", "VCS.API", ["RebuildAddIn", "C:\\\\Repos\\\\msaccess-vcs-addin\\\\Version Control.accda.src\\\\"])

    Args:
        database_path: Path to Access database (.accdb, .accda, .mdb)
        function_name: Fully qualified function name (e.g., "ModuleName.FunctionName"),
            or a VCS add-in alias such as "VCS.API"
        args: Optional list of string arguments to pass to the function
        timeout_seconds: Optional server-side timeout. Defaults to
            ACCESS_VCS_CALL_VBA_TIMEOUT_SEC (45 seconds). Keep below the MCP
            client's request timeout or the client may return -32001 with no JSON.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with the function's return value or error. RebuildAddIn calls
        also include ``rebuild_status_file`` and ``rebuild_status_before``.

      - `temp_module_cleanup_failed` + `cleanupFailed` + `orphanModule`:
        wrapper survived cleanup; a completed return is preserved as
        `payloadResult`

    Stop and tell the user when cleanup fails rather than repeatedly issuing
    calls against a project with an orphaned wrapper.
    
    The agent's code should set the function return value via the
    MCP_TempFunction identifier. Example:
        Dim result As String
        result = CurrentDb.QueryDefs("qryCustomers").SQL
        MCP_TempFunction = result
    
    **Line-number debugging:**
    The add-in auto-prepends sequential 1-based VBA line numbers to every
    executable line in `code` before running it. When a runtime error fires
    inside the wrapper, the response includes an `errorLine` field whose
    value equals the 1-based line number within the `code` string you
    submitted. The counter advances on every physical input line (blanks,
    comments, and `_` continuations included) even though only executable
    lines actually carry a number, so `errorLine: 7` means "line 7 of what
    I sent" -- you can index into your own `code` directly.
    
    Default behavior is to capture the LAST runtime error (the wrapper uses
    `On Error Resume Next` so all statements run). For a richer pattern that
    collects every failing line in one round-trip, use an explicit handler:
    
        Dim col As New Collection
        On Error GoTo H
        CurrentDb.Execute "DELETE * FROM tblA"
        CurrentDb.Execute "INSERT INTO tblB SELECT * FROM nope"
        CurrentDb.Execute "UPDATE tblC SET x = 1"
        MCP_TempFunction = "errors=" & col.Count
        Exit Function
        H: col.Add Erl & ": " & Err.Number & " " & Err.Description
        Resume Next
    
    Each `Erl` value inside the handler is meaningful (and matches an
    `errorLine` you would have seen) because the wrapper auto-numbered
    every line for you.
    
    **Host-project compile failures:**
    If the response includes `compileError` stating the host project does not
    compile on its own, the failure is in existing database VBA — not your
    submitted `code`. Stop and ask the user to compile in the VBE (Debug →
    Compile) and paste the code snippet around the highlighted line. Do not
    treat `generatedSource` as the fix target unless the response says the
    failure is in the agent code.
    
    Examples:
        vcs_run_vba("C:\\\\db.accdb", "MCP_TempFunction = CurrentDb.TableDefs.Count")
        vcs_run_vba("C:\\\\db.accdb", "Dim qd As DAO.QueryDef\\nSet qd = CurrentDb.QueryDefs(\\"qryTest\\")\\nMCP_TempFunction = qd.SQL")

        `error_pattern`, `errorNumber`, and `errorLine` (the 1-based line
        in `code` that raised the captured error; omitted when not
        available). Reset, sweep, canary, and cleanup failures include the
        actionable fields described above.

    Run VBA tests in the database using the VCS add-in's built-in test runner.

    Discovers test modules (standard modules and classes containing TestAssert
    calls), executes their test procedures, and returns structured JSON results
    with per-test status, assertion details, timing, and tags.

    Headless here means no add-in UI (no web runner, no console form, silent
    dialogs) -- not a hidden Access window. The host instance stays visible.

    **Live output:** MCP progress is best-effort in Cursor. For a live stream
    (dots for fast passes, names for tests ≥ 1s, FAIL lines, then a human
    completion line), run ``msaccess-vcs run-tests <database>`` from a
    terminal and keep that command in the foreground. This tool still returns
    the full ``tests`` map for programmatic reruns.

    **Filter syntax** (comma-separated, applied as a single string):

    Each comma-separated element is resolved in priority order:
    1. Module name -- exact match (e.g. ``modTestEncoding``)
    2. Suite/folder -- match against ``@Folder`` annotations (e.g. ``SQL``)
    3. Procedure name -- match on procedure or ``Module.Procedure`` key
    4. Tag -- match against ``@Tag`` annotations (e.g. ``unit``)

    Prefix any element with ``-`` to exclude. Inclusions combine with OR;
    exclusions combine with AND.

    **Iterative workflow:** The response includes per-test entries keyed by
    ``Module.Procedure``. To rerun only failures, pass those keys back as
    the filter (e.g. ``"modTestFoo.TestBar,clsTestBaz.TestQux"``).

    **Prerequisite:** The target database must have ``modTestAssert`` installed
    (via the VCS ribbon or ``VCS.InstallTestAssertModule``). In unattended mode
    the install prompt is suppressed, so pre-install before calling this tool.

    **To run the add-in's own suite, pass the development copy in its repository** --
    the ``Version Control.accda`` beside ``Version Control.accda.src``. The runner scans
    the current VBA project, so the host database is the code under test, while the
    installed add-in loads as a library and supplies the runner and TestAssert. Passing
    the installed add-in is refused with ``installed_addin_refused`` before it is opened.

    Examples:
        vcs_run_tests("C:\\\\db.accdb")
        vcs_run_tests("C:\\\\db.accdb", filter="modTestEncoding")

        filter: Optional comma-separated filter string. When omitted, runs

        timeout_seconds: How long to wait for the async run (default from the
            add-in's timeout_ms, 10 minutes). Unused on the sync fallback.

        and at least one test ran), ``summary``, ``tests``, ``durationMs``,
        and other fields from the test runner JSON output.
