# msaccess-vcs-mcp

A lightweight MCP server (Model Context Protocol server) that provides AI agent integration for the [MSAccess VCS Add-in](https://github.com/joyfullservice/msaccess-vcs-integration). This tool acts as a bridge, allowing AI assistants (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code, and other MCP-compatible clients) to work with Microsoft Access databases through version control operations.

## Features

- **Full Export**: Export all database objects (forms, reports, queries, modules, macros, etc.)
- **Fast Save**: Incremental exports (only changed objects)
- **Per-Object Operations**: Export or import individual objects by name and type
- **Merge Build**: Import source changes into existing database
- **Build from Source**: Create fresh database from source files
- **Object Inventory**: List all objects in an Access database
- **Change Tracking**: Compare database against source files
- **SQL Queries**: Execute read-only SELECT queries via the add-in's DAO connection
- **VBA Execution**: Call existing VBA functions or run agent-generated code
- **Async Operations**: Long-running exports/builds report progress via HTTP callbacks
- **Add-in Options**: Read and write VCS add-in settings at runtime
- **Safety Guardrails**: Path validation, permission checks, and write-disable mode

## Architecture

This MCP server is a **lightweight wrapper** around the MSAccess VCS add-in, delegating all database operations to the battle-tested add-in:

```
AI Agent -> MCP Server (Python) -> VCS Add-in (VBA) -> Access Database
                |
          Path validation
          Permission checks
          Result formatting
          Async progress tracking
```

All business logic lives in VBA. The MCP layer validates inputs, manages async lifecycle, and formats responses.

### Access windows are visible

When a tool needs Access, the window is shown rather than kept hidden — expect an Access window to appear if one isn't already open. This is intentional: Access asks questions that only a person can answer (trust prompts, "convert this database?", a VBA error breaking into the debugger), and an operation that stalls behind an invisible dialog looks like a hang with no way to clear it. The server never closes an Access window it did not open.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Microsoft Access**: Installed on Windows (for COM automation)
- **pywin32**: Python COM interface (installed automatically)

If MCP startup fails with a `CLSIDToClassMap` / `win32com.gen_py` error, the server deletes the stale type-library folder under `%TEMP%\gen_py` and retries once automatically. If it still fails after that, Microsoft Access is probably not installed or not registered for COM automation.
- **MSAccess VCS Add-in**: Must be installed ([download latest release](https://github.com/joyfullservice/msaccess-vcs-integration/releases/latest))

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get running is with [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) (the tool runner from uv). No cloning or virtual environments needed.

### 1. Install uv

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Install the MSAccess VCS Add-in

This MCP server requires the MSAccess VCS add-in to be installed.

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/joyfullservice/msaccess-vcs-integration/releases/latest) from GitHub
2. Extract `Version Control.accda` to a trusted location
3. Open `Version Control.accda` to launch the installer
4. Click **Install Add-In**

The add-in will be installed to `%AppData%\MSAccessVCS\Version Control.accda` by default.

### 3. Register the MCP server

Add the server entry to your MCP client config. Both Cursor and Claude Code use the same `mcpServers` format, just in different files:

| Client | Project-level config | User-level (global) config |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` | `~/.claude.json` |

Add this to the appropriate config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msaccess-vcs-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["msaccess-vcs-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `@latest` suffix ensures `uvx` always pulls the latest version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/msaccess-vcs-mcp/) instead of using a cached copy.

**Alternative for Claude Code** -- you can use the CLI instead of editing JSON:

```bash
claude mcp add msaccess-vcs-mcp -- uvx msaccess-vcs-mcp@latest
```

### 4. Configure your database

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Target database for this project
ACCESS_VCS_DATABASE=C:\Projects\MyApp\database.accdb

# Optional: Disable database writes for safety
# ACCESS_VCS_DISABLE_WRITES=true

# Optional: Custom add-in path
# ACCESS_VCS_ADDIN_PATH=C:\Custom\Path\Version Control.accda
```

### 5. Restart your client

Close and reopen Cursor or Claude Code. The MCP server will be detected and loaded automatically.

### 6. Try it out

Ask the AI assistant to use the VCS tools:

> "List all objects in my Access database using vcs_list_objects"

> "Export my Access database to the src folder using vcs_export_database"

> "Compare my database against the source files using vcs_diff_database"

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables, typically in a `.env` file in your project root. The server loads `.env` automatically at startup.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `ACCESS_VCS_DATABASE` | Target database path (.accdb, .accda, .mdb) | - | Recommended |
| `ACCESS_VCS_PROJECT_DIR` | Explicit path to the project containing your `.env` (overrides auto-discovery) | auto | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_ADDIN_PATH` | Path to VCS add-in file | `%AppData%\MSAccessVCS\Version Control.accda` | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_DISABLE_WRITES` | Disable database modifications (`true`/`false`) | `false` | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_CALLBACK_ENABLED` | Enable HTTP callback server for async progress | `true` | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_CALLBACK_HOST` | Host address for callback server | `127.0.0.1` | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_VALIDATE_STARTUP` | Validate Access and add-in availability on startup | `false` | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_ENABLE_LOGGING` | Enable structured JSONL usage logging | `false` | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_LOG_DIR` | Custom log directory (overrides auto-detection) | auto | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB` | Max log file size before rotation | `10` | No |
| `ACCESS_VCS_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` | Number of rotated backup files to keep | `5` | No |

### Project-Specific Configuration

This tool supports per-project configurations using `.env` files:

#### `.env` (Gitignored, Project-Specific)

Store project-specific database path:

```bash
ACCESS_VCS_DATABASE=C:\Projects\MyApp\database.accdb
```

#### `.env.local` (Optional, Gitignored)

For personal overrides that shouldn't affect the team:

```bash
ACCESS_VCS_DATABASE=C:\Users\YourName\dev\testdb.accdb
```

### Environment Variable Precedence

1. **MCP server `env` section** (highest priority) -- values set in the MCP config file
2. **`.env.local`** -- personal overrides
3. **`.env`** -- project-specific configuration (lowest priority)

### Using msaccess-vcs-mcp from Another Project

When the server is installed once at the user level (in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` rather than per-project), it still needs to find each individual project's `.env` so that settings like `ACCESS_VCS_DATABASE` and `ACCESS_VCS_ENABLE_LOGGING` take effect. The server resolves the project root in the following order:

1. **`ACCESS_VCS_PROJECT_DIR`** -- explicit override, set in the MCP `env` section if needed.
2. **MCP workspace roots** -- when the client (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, etc.) supports `roots/list`, the server lazily discovers the workspace on the first tool call and loads `.env` from it. No configuration required.
3. **Upward search from the working directory** -- works automatically when the IDE launches the server with the workspace as `cwd` (the typical case).
4. **Upward search from the installed package location** -- last-resort fallback for development installs.

`.env` files are also hot-reloaded: editing `.env` while the server is running causes the next tool call to pick up the new values, including `ACCESS_VCS_ENABLE_LOGGING`.

The server prints diagnostics to stderr at startup (visible in Cursor's MCP server output pane) showing the resolved project root and which files were loaded -- check there first if a setting isn't taking effect.

## Available Tools

### Database-Level Operations

#### `vcs_export_database(database_path, output_dir, object_types, full_export)`

Export Access database objects to source files via the VCS add-in.

With no `object_types`, exports the whole project (async progress). With
`object_types`, exports only those categories via a scoped sync call. Uses
fast save by default (only changed objects).

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database (.accdb, .accda, .mdb)
- `output_dir`: Directory to export source files to
- `object_types`: Optional list of categories (defaults to entire project)
- `full_export`: If True, export all objects in scope (not just changed ones)

**Returns:** `success`, `exported_count`, `export_path`, `objects_by_type`, `log_path`

```python
vcs_export_database("C:\\db.accdb", "C:\\src\\mydb")

vcs_export_database("C:\\db.accdb", "C:\\src\\mydb", object_types=["modules"])
```

#### `vcs_list_objects(database_path)`

List all objects in an Access database by type.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database

**Returns:** `tables`, `queries`, `modules` (and `forms`, `reports` in future)

```python
vcs_list_objects("C:\\db.accdb")
```

#### `vcs_diff_database(database_path, source_dir, show_details)`

Compare database objects against source files to see what has changed.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `source_dir`: Directory containing source files
- `show_details`: If True, show detailed diff

**Returns:** `queries`, `modules`, `new_in_db`, `new_in_source`

```python
vcs_diff_database("C:\\db.accdb", "C:\\src\\mydb")
```

#### `vcs_import_objects(database_path, source_dir, object_types, full_import)`

Import objects from source files into Access database using merge build.

With no `object_types`, runs a full project merge. With `object_types`, merges
only those categories (orphan reconciliation within them; no database backup).
Requires write permission.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `source_dir`: Directory containing source files
- `object_types`: Optional list of categories to merge (e.g. `["queries"]`)
- `full_import`: When scoped: if True, merge all source files in those
  categories (ignore change index); if False (default), only changed files

```python
vcs_import_objects("C:\\db.accdb", "C:\\src\\mydb")
vcs_import_objects("C:\\db.accdb", "C:\\src\\mydb", object_types=["modules"], full_import=True)
```

#### `vcs_rebuild_database(source_dir, output_path, template_path)`

Build a complete Access database from source files.

Creates a fresh database from source files, useful for clean builds and distribution. Requires write permission.

**Args:**
- `source_dir`: Directory containing source files
- `output_path`: Path for the new database file
- `template_path`: Optional template database to use as starting point

```python
vcs_rebuild_database("C:\\src\\mydb", "C:\\output\\fresh.accdb")
```

#### Rebuilding the VCS add-in itself

`vcs_rebuild_database` rebuilds a *user* project. To rebuild `Version Control.accda` from `Version Control.accda.src` after editing add-in source:

```python
result = vcs_call_vba(
    r"C:\path\to\msaccess-vcs-addin\Version Control.accda",
    "VCS.API",
    ["RebuildAddIn", r"C:\path\to\msaccess-vcs-addin\Version Control.accda.src"],
)
# result["result"] is JSON with status and statusFile.
# On "launched", poll <source>/logs/rebuild-status.json until complete or *-failed,
# matching phaseStarted against result["rebuild_phase_started"].
```

The first argument only picks the Access instance that hosts the call — the source folder is what decides the rebuild. Host it on the development copy of the add-in in its repository, the `Version Control.accda` beside the source folder: rebuilding the add-in is a repository operation and belongs to the repository's own copy, which closes itself once the worker handoff is confirmed. Do not open a user database, anything in the repository's `Testing` folder, or a scratch `.accdb` to satisfy the parameter. The installed add-in is refused here as everywhere — see [The installed add-in is never a target](#the-installed-add-in-is-never-a-target).

The rebuild refuses when another `MSACCESS.EXE` in the Windows session holds one of the files it replaces — it checks the loaded VBA projects in each one, so an instance with an unrelated database open is left alone. An instance that cannot be asked also blocks it, because a busy instance rejects the automation calls that would answer and so looks identical to an idle one. It never closes another Access process. On refusal, `otherInstances` names each process, what was observed about it, and which file it holds, so you can close them deliberately.

`refused` and `launch-failed` come back in the call's own JSON and mean nothing was rebuilt, so there is nothing to poll for. `launch-failed` means the helper script never started; Access is left open and the call is safe to retry. Only a `launched` result is worth polling, and the add-in confirms the worker is actually running before returning it. Access exits a few seconds later, so a COM error on that call is possible.

#### Running the add-in's own tests

Pass the development copy in the add-in's repository as the database path:

```python
vcs_run_tests(r"C:\path\to\msaccess-vcs-addin\Version Control.accda", filter="clsTestInstall")
```

A run needs two projects and they are different files: the installed add-in loads as a library and supplies the runner and `TestAssert`, while the code under test is whatever the current database holds. The runner scans the current VBA project, so the host decides which tests are found — a run aimed at a user database, or at anything in the repository's `Testing` folder, finds that database's tests instead. The server opens the development copy as the current database for you, so there is no manual pre-open step.

The installed add-in is refused as a host (see below), and it has no source tree beside it for the tests that read one. The add-in refuses such a run itself, so the server's refusal is the earlier of two.

#### The installed add-in is never a target

No tool accepts the installed add-in as `database_path`, `output_path`, or `template_path`. That file exists to be loaded as a library: opening it as a database, or writing into it, resets a VBA project while it is executing. The check runs before the Access gate and before any COM work, so it applies to every tool — export, import, rebuild, `vcs_run_vba`, `vcs_run_tests`, `vcs_call_vba`, and the rest. Refusals carry `error_pattern: installed_addin_refused`.

`vcs_get_version_info()` reports the installed add-in's version without opening it.

The comparison ignores the file extension, since a compiled install is a `.accde` built from the same `.accda`. Folder parameters are not checked — an export folder beside the install is not the install.

With `ACCESS_VCS_ADDIN_PATH` unset, the install path comes from `HKCU\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\MSAccessVCS\Install`, the same `Install Folder` and `Compile accde` values the add-in's own installer writes. `Install Folder` is absent for a default install, which means `%AppData%\MSAccessVCS`.

Run these tests through the server rather than from the add-in's own window. Assertions are recorded by the runner in whichever project received the call, while `TestAssert` always routes to the *installed* add-in, so a run started inside a development copy discards every assertion and reports `EMPTY` for each test. An all-`EMPTY` result means the harness was bypassed, not that the tests passed.

### Per-Object Operations

#### `vcs_export_object(database_path, object_type, object_name)`

Export a single named database object to its source file. Much faster than a full database export when you only need to refresh one object.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `object_type`: Type of object: `"query"`, `"form"`, `"report"`, `"module"`, `"table"`, `"macro"`
- `object_name`: Name of the object to export

```python
vcs_export_object("C:\\db.accdb", "query", "qryCustomers")
vcs_export_object("C:\\db.accdb", "module", "modUtils")
```

#### `vcs_import_object(database_path, object_type, object_name)`

Import a single named object from source files into the database. The source file must exist in the project's export folder. Requires write permission.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `object_type`: Type of object: `"query"`, `"form"`, `"report"`, `"module"`, `"table"`, `"macro"`
- `object_name`: Name of the object to import

```python
vcs_import_object("C:\\db.accdb", "query", "qryCustomers")
vcs_import_object("C:\\db.accdb", "module", "modUtils")
```

### SQL and VBA Execution

#### `vcs_execute_sql(database_path, sql, max_rows)`

Execute a read-only SELECT query against the database via the add-in's DAO connection.

Only SELECT statements are allowed -- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and DDL are rejected. Uses the same database connection the add-in already holds, avoiding file-locking conflicts.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `sql`: SELECT statement to execute
- `max_rows`: Maximum number of rows to return (default: 100)

**Returns:** `rows`, `rowCount`, `truncated`

```python
vcs_execute_sql("C:\\db.accdb", "SELECT Name, Type FROM MSysObjects WHERE Type=5")
vcs_execute_sql("C:\\db.accdb", "SELECT * FROM Customers", max_rows=50)
```

#### `vcs_call_vba(database_path, function_name, args)`

Call an existing public VBA function by name via `Application.Run`. Lighter weight than `vcs_run_vba` since there is no temp module creation or compilation step.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `function_name`: Fully qualified function name (e.g., `"ModuleName.FunctionName"`)
- `args`: Optional list of string arguments (max 3)

```python
vcs_call_vba("C:\\db.accdb", "MyModule.GetQuerySQL", ["qryCustomers"])
vcs_call_vba("C:\\db.accdb", "Version Control.API", ["GetVCSVersion"])
```

#### `vcs_run_vba(database_path, code)`

Execute agent-generated VBA code in a temporary module.

The add-in handles the full lifecycle: creates a temp module, wraps the code in a function with error handling, compiles the project to validate, executes, captures the result, removes the temp module, and returns structured JSON.

**Requires `McpAllowRunVBA` option to be enabled** (default: off). The user must enable this manually in the VCS Options form — agents cannot set this option programmatically.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `code`: VBA code block to execute

```python
vcs_run_vba("C:\\db.accdb", "MCP_TempFunction = CurrentDb.TableDefs.Count")
```

### VBA Compilation

#### `vcs_check_vba_compiled(database_path)`

Check if VBA code in an Access database is compiled. Returns the compilation state without attempting to compile. Useful for establishing a baseline before making code changes.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database

**Returns:** `success`, `compiled`

```python
result = vcs_check_vba_compiled("C:\\db.accdb")
# result["compiled"] -> True or False
```

#### `vcs_compile_vba(database_path, suppress_warnings)`

Compile all VBA modules in an Access database and return success status.

When compilation fails, MCP cannot report the failing module or line. **Stop
making further code changes.** Ask the user to open the database in Access,
open the Visual Basic Editor, and choose **Debug → Compile** — Access navigates
to the first error line. Ask the user to paste the code around that line (a few
lines above and below). Once you have the snippet, propose a targeted fix; do not
guess or iterate through speculative edits.

The response includes an `agent_guidance` field when compilation fails.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `suppress_warnings`: If True, suppress message boxes during compilation

**Returns:** `success`

```python
result = vcs_compile_vba("C:\\db.accdb", suppress_warnings=True)
```

### Add-in Options

#### `vcs_set_option(database_path, option_name, value)`

Set a VCS add-in option for the current session.

Changes take effect immediately but do not persist to `vcs-options.json` until explicitly saved.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `option_name`: Name of the VCS option property
- `value`: Value to set (string, boolean, or integer)

```python
vcs_set_option("C:\\db.accdb", "ShowDebug", True)
```

#### `vcs_get_option(database_path, option_name)`

Read a VCS add-in option value.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `option_name`: Name of the VCS option property to read

```python
vcs_get_option("C:\\db.accdb", "ShowDebug")
vcs_get_option("C:\\db.accdb", "McpAllowRunVBA")
```

### Diagnostics

#### `vcs_get_version_info()`

Get version information for MCP server, MSAccess VCS add-in, and Access application.

Returns `mcp_version`, `vcs_version`, `access_version`, `bitness`, `target_database`, `addin_path`, `callback_url`, `async_available`, and any `errors` or `warnings`.

```python
vcs_get_version_info()
```

#### `vcs_cancel_operation(operation_id)`

Cancel a running async operation. Requests cancellation of a long-running export, build, or import. The VBA add-in will detect the cancellation during its next DoEvents cycle.

**Args:**
- `operation_id`: UUID of the operation to cancel (returned by async tool calls)

```python
vcs_cancel_operation("a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab")
```

#### `vcs_get_log(database_path, log_type)`

Read the most recent operation log file from the source folder's logs directory.

**Args:**
- `database_path`: Path to Access database
- `log_type`: Type of log to read: `"Export"` (default) or `"Build"`

```python
vcs_get_log("C:\\db.accdb")
vcs_get_log("C:\\db.accdb", log_type="Build")
```

## Async Operations

Long-running operations (export, import, rebuild) support async execution with progress reporting. When the callback server is running (enabled by default), these operations:

1. Spawn a detached VBA process via the add-in's `APIAsync` entry point
2. Return immediately with an `operation_id`
3. Receive progress updates via HTTP callbacks from VBA
4. Support cancellation via `vcs_cancel_operation`

The server automatically detects when another operation is in progress for the same database and returns a busy response with the active operation details.

If the callback server is not available, operations fall back to synchronous execution.

See [docs/VBA_CALLBACK_API.md](docs/VBA_CALLBACK_API.md) for the full callback protocol specification.

## Export Format

The VCS add-in exports database objects to a comprehensive folder structure with text-based files. See the [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/joyfullservice/msaccess-vcs-integration/blob/main/Version%20Control.accda.src/AGENTS.md) guide for complete format documentation.

### Example Structure

```
database.src/
├── queries/           # SQL queries (.sql, .bas)
├── modules/           # VBA modules (.bas, .cls)
├── forms/             # Form definitions (.bas, .cls)
├── reports/           # Report definitions (.bas, .cls)
├── macros/            # Macros (.bas)
├── tables/            # Table data (.txt, .xml)
├── tbldefs/           # Table structure (.sql, .xml)
├── vcs-options.json   # Export options
├── vcs-index.json     # Fast save index
└── Export.log         # Operation log
```

All files use **UTF-8 with BOM** encoding, which is critical for proper import back into Access.

## Workflows

### Version Control Workflow

```python
# 1. Export database to source
vcs_export_database("C:\\db.accdb", "C:\\src\\db")

# 2. Initialize git (if not already done)
# cd C:\src\db && git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial export"

# 3. Make changes in Access...

# 4. See what changed
vcs_diff_database("C:\\db.accdb", "C:\\src\\db")

# 5. Export changes
vcs_export_database("C:\\db.accdb", "C:\\src\\db")

# 6. Commit changes
# git add . && git commit -m "Updated customer queries"
```

### Per-Object Development Workflow

```python
# 1. Edit a VBA module in source files...

# 2. Import just that module
vcs_import_object("C:\\db.accdb", "module", "modUtils")

# 3. Compile to validate
vcs_compile_vba("C:\\db.accdb")

# 4. Test via VBA
vcs_call_vba("C:\\db.accdb", "modUtils.RunTests")

# 5. Export the module back (picks up any Access-side formatting)
vcs_export_object("C:\\db.accdb", "module", "modUtils")
```

### Integration with db-inspector-mcp

Both tools work together for comprehensive database workflows:

```python
# 1. Analyze database structure (db-inspector-mcp)
db_list_tables(database="legacy")
db_list_views(database="legacy")

# 2. Export to version control (msaccess-vcs-mcp)
vcs_export_database("C:\\legacy.accdb", "C:\\src\\legacy-db")

# 3. Run queries against the database (msaccess-vcs-mcp)
vcs_execute_sql("C:\\legacy.accdb", "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Active = True")

# 4. Cross-database comparison (db-inspector-mcp)
db_compare_queries(
    "SELECT * FROM Customers",
    "SELECT * FROM Customers",
    database1="legacy",
    database2="new"
)
```

## MCP Client Setup

### Cursor

**Project-level** -- add `.cursor/mcp.json` to your project root (can be version-controlled for team sharing):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msaccess-vcs-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["msaccess-vcs-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**User-level** -- add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` to make the server available in all projects.

### Claude Code

**Project-level** -- add `.mcp.json` to your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msaccess-vcs-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["msaccess-vcs-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**CLI alternative** -- register without editing JSON:

```bash
claude mcp add msaccess-vcs-mcp -- uvx msaccess-vcs-mcp@latest
```

### Development Install

For contributing or running from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joyfullservice/msaccess-vcs-mcp.git
cd msaccess-vcs-mcp
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For development installs, use `python -m msaccess_vcs_mcp.main` as the command in your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msaccess-vcs-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "msaccess_vcs_mcp.main"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

If the MCP server doesn't load:

1. **Check MCP logs** -- In Cursor, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and look for MCP-related output. In Claude Code, check the terminal output.

2. **Verify the command works** -- run `uvx msaccess-vcs-mcp --help` in your terminal.

3. **Check your `.env` file** -- make sure it's in the project root, the database path is correct, and there are no syntax errors.

## Security Model

### Write Operations

Database write operations (import, rebuild, run VBA) are **enabled by default**. To prevent modifications:

```bash
ACCESS_VCS_DISABLE_WRITES=true
```

### VBA Execution Permissions

VBA execution has two tiers with separate permissions controlled via add-in options:

- **`vcs_call_vba`**: Calls existing named functions via `Application.Run`. Controlled by `McpAllowCallVBA` (default: True).
- **`vcs_run_vba`**: Executes agent-generated code via temp module. Controlled by `McpAllowRunVBA` (default: False). Must be explicitly enabled by the user in the VCS Options form — agents cannot enable this option programmatically via `vcs_set_option`.

### Path Validation

All file paths are validated to prevent:
- Access to system directories
- Invalid file extensions
- Non-existent paths (unless creating)

### Code Execution Audit Trail

When usage logging is enabled (`ACCESS_VCS_ENABLE_LOGGING=true`), every call to `vcs_execute_sql`, `vcs_call_vba`, or `vcs_run_vba` writes a `"code_execution"` event **before** the code runs. This entry preserves the full, untruncated SQL or VBA text alongside the target database path — providing a forensic record even if the process crashes during execution.

```jsonc
// Example log entry (written before execution)
{
  "event": "code_execution",
  "tool": "vcs_execute_sql",
  "database": "C:\\Projects\\mydb.accdb",
  "code_type": "sql",
  "code": "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Active = True",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-15T18:30:00+00:00",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

The standard post-execution `"tool_call"` event follows with success/error status and timing.

### Safe Workflow

For safety when working with production databases:
1. Set `ACCESS_VCS_DISABLE_WRITES=true` in production
2. Use export operations to review changes
3. Enable writes only when ready to merge changes

## Development

### Running Tests

Tests must run inside the project virtual environment:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment first
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # Windows PowerShell
# source venv/bin/activate           # macOS/Linux

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=msaccess_vcs_mcp --cov-report=html

# Skip integration tests (require Access installed)
pytest -m "not integration"
```
